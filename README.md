# Creation of a professional data portfolio
# I. Context
ESN data is structured into several divisions, each dedicated to a specific business sector.

Within each division, business managers are responsible for developing their own revenue streams. To achieve this, they rely on consultants' expertise to execute various client missions.

An opportunity has been offered to me to join an international team for a project scheduled to start in two weeks.

This four-month mission, for a major aeronautics manufacturer, will involve several trips across Europe.

The objective of the mission is to optimise the supply chain with their suppliers. It will require analysing data and creating dashboards for the logistics management teams.

To apply for this position, I needed to design a dashboard that demonstrates my skills and supports my application. Additionally, I had to build a portfolio showcasing the projects I have completed.

# II. Methodology
## 1. Data collection
Download the dataset “Référentiel de Compétences”, which contains all the certifying skills acquired during my training.

Clean the dataset by keeping only the relevant data to be highlighted in the dashboard.

Review all the completed projects to recall the skills learned and applied.

## 2. Skills assessment
Identify the hard skills and soft skills to be emphasised in the dashboard.

Request feedback from my mentor to help assess my skill level before and after each completed project.

Conduct a self-assessment using the tools and frameworks introduced during my training.

## 3. Dashboard design
Create a mind map to define a visual identity and choose an appropriate color palette.

Explore Power BI for design inspiration and examples of possible visualisations.

Draft a mock-up using a collaborative workspace to plan which skills will be displayed in each chart.

Add notes to document and explain the structure of the dashboard.

## 4. Data Files preparation
Create data tables and populate them with the necessary information.

Define the variables (columns) that will serve as keys to link the tables.

## 5. Interactive dashboard creation
Import the data files.

Create multiple visualisations to represent my skills.

Use parameters and calculated fields to enhance the insights and usability of the dashboard.

Add filters to allow dynamic interactions between the charts and display progress.

Assemble the visualisations into dashboards and ensure proper interactivity.

Include a link to my GitHub portfolio.

## 6. Portfolio creation
Use the collaborative workspace GitHub to design and share my portfolio.

Create dedicated sections for each completed project (repositories).

Describe the context, methodology, technologies used, and references for each project.

Include deliverables (eg: presentations, scripts, reports) to illustrate my work.

Embed a link to the interactive dashboard.
