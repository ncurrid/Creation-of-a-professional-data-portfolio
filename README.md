# Creation of a professional data portfolio
# I. Context
ESN data is structured into several divisions, each dedicated to a specific business sector. Within each division, business managers are responsible for developing their own revenue streams. To achieve this, they rely on consultants' expertise to execute various client missions. 

An opportunity has been offered to me to join an international team at Aéroworld, a global leader in aerospace. Aéroworld is recruiting a Data Analyst Project Manager to tackle major data challenges. The company generates massive volumes of data (flight tests, sensors, maintenance, clients) and needs robust systems like Data Lakes for structured management. Key technical issues include data integration and interoperability, cybersecurity and confidentiality, scalable infrastructure, and the use of AI and machine learning for analysis. The ideal candidate must be experienced, adaptable, and with a consulting mindset. 

To apply for this position, I have designed an interactive dashboard and a portfolio showcasing the projects that I have completed and the certificates that I have obtained.
