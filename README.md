# Creation of a professional data portfolio
# I. Context
ESN data is structured into several divisions, each dedicated to a specific business sector. Within each division, business managers are responsible for developing their own revenue streams. To achieve this, they rely on consultants' expertise to execute various client missions. 

An opportunity has been offered to me to join an international team at Aéroworld, a global leader in aerospace. Aéroworld is recruiting a Data Analyst Project Manager to tackle major data challenges. The company generates massive volumes of data (flight tests, sensors, maintenance, clients) and needs robust systems like Data Lakes for structured management. Key technical issues include data integration and interoperability, cybersecurity and confidentiality, scalable infrastructure, and the use of AI and machine learning for analysis. 

The ideal candidate must be experienced, adaptable, and with a consulting mindset. 

To apply for this position, I have designed an interactive dashboard and a portfolio showcasing the projects that I have completed.

# II. Methodology
## 1. Data collection
Download the dataset “Référentiel de Compétences”, which contains all the certifying skills acquired during my training.

Clean the dataset by keeping only the relevant data to be highlighted in the dashboard.

Review all the completed projects to recall the skills learned and applied.

## 2. Skills assessment
Identify the hard skills and soft skills to be emphasised in the dashboard.

Request feedback from my mentor to help assess my skill level before and after each completed project.

Conduct a self-assessment using the tools and frameworks introduced during my training.

## 3. Dashboard design
Create a mind map to define a visual identity and choose an appropriate color palette.

Explore Power BI for design inspiration and examples of possible visualisations.

Draft a mock-up using a collaborative workspace to plan which skills will be displayed in each chart.

Add notes to document and explain the structure of the dashboard.

## 4. Data Files preparation
Create data tables and populate them with the necessary information.

Define the variables (columns) that will serve as keys to link the tables.

## 5. Interactive dashboard creation
Import the data files.

Create multiple visualisations to represent my skills.

Use parameters and calculated fields to enhance the insights and usability of the dashboard.

Add filters to allow dynamic interactions between the charts and display progress.

Assemble the visualisations into dashboards and ensure proper interactivity.

Include a link to my GitHub portfolio.

## 6. Portfolio creation
Use the collaborative workspace GitHub to design and share my portfolio.

Create dedicated sections for each completed project (repositories).

Describe the context, methodology, technologies used, and references for each project.

Include deliverables (eg: presentations, scripts, reports) to illustrate my work.

Embed a link to the interactive dashboard.
